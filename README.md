## Project File

`imm_face_db/` directory should contain the IMM Face Database for part 1&2.

`ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset/` directory should contain the face database for part 3&4.

`my_collection/` directory should contain three photos from my collection and one .txt file indicating the bounding boxes for the face.

`kaggle/` directory should contain everything for class Kaggle competition, including the Kaggle test set .xml file and the result .csv file.

`output/` directory should contain all the output images in .jpg format and checkpoint files in .pt format.

`main.ipynb` has code for all parts. Note that it should be able to run on Google Colab with GPU.

`main.py` has the same code as in `main.ipynb`.
